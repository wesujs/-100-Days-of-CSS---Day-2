## Day 2 of 100 Days of Coding with CSS!

Same Day as first day because I felt as if I could do more and I feel like I did a good job on this button template!

There wasnt anything hard about this and I was done in about 20 minutes with this one. A big upgrade from the last which had me stuck on it for about an hour ðŸ˜….
